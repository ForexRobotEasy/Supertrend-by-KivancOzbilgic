# Supertrend by KivancOzbilgic

Supertrend is a custom indicator developed by KivancOzbilgic. This code is an example implementation of the Supertrend indicator in MQL5. It calculates the Supertrend value based on the specified period and multiplier, and provides buy and sell signals based on the Supertrend crossing the close price. It also includes functionality for setting stop loss and take profit levels.

## Input Parameters

- **period**: The period for calculating the Supertrend. Default value is 10.
- **multiplier**: The multiplier for calculating the Supertrend. Default value is 3.0.
- **stopLoss**: The stop loss level. Default value is 50.
- **takeProfit**: The take profit level. Default value is 100.

## Initialization

The indicator initialization function `OnInit()` is called when the indicator is attached to a chart. It sets up the indicator buffers and properties, and initializes the Supertrend.

## Calculation

The indicator iteration function `OnCalculate()` is called for each new tick. It calculates the Supertrend, checks for buy and sell signals based on the Supertrend crossing the close price, and manages stop loss and take profit levels.

## Supertrend Calculation

The Supertrend calculation is not provided in this code and should be implemented according to your own strategy. The calculated Supertrend value should be assigned to the `supertrend` variable in the `CalculateSupertrend()` function.

## Position Management

The `OpenPosition()` function is responsible for opening long or short positions based on the specified type. The logic for opening positions should be implemented in this function.

The `ClosePosition()` function is responsible for closing the current position. The logic for closing positions should be implemented in this function.

The `GetPositionProfit()` function is responsible for calculating the profit of the current position. The logic for calculating the position profit should be implemented in this function.

## Alert and Notification

The `SendAlert()` function is responsible for sending alerts or notifications. The logic for sending alerts should be implemented in this function.
